    "With around half of its population born outside the country, Toronto is often referred to as ‘the most multicultural city in the world.’ Located in Canada, this city boasts 200 ethnic groups with over 140 languages spoken. People from the UK, Ireland, China and Italy, to name a few, represent some of the larger cultural groups, while smaller communities include people from Iran, the Netherlands, Nepal and Romania. Toronto also features dozens of international neighborhoods waiting to be explored, including Chinatown, Greektown, Roncesvalles Village (Little Poland), Little Italy, and Little India."

    "DATA DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of Toronto (as we did in the Module of the 3rd week), in terms of their neighborhoods.\n",
    "The data include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from Toronto to analyze its neighborhoods, the seleceted Borough was Downtown Toronto.\n",
    "We will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on activity in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate which area/neighborhood can provide us a 'peaceful' way of living."

    "As we did in Week 3's assesment, we have extracted table of Toronto’s Borough from Wikipedia page. Then we arrange the data according to our requirements. In the arrangement phase, which applied multiple steps including but not limited to, eliminating “Not assigned” values, combine neighborhoods which have same geographical coordinates at each borough and sorted against the concerned borough. For data verification and further exploration, we use Foursquare API to get the coordinates of Downtown Toronto and explore its neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are further characterized as venues and venue categories."
